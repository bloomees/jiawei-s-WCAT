# 🧠 Will Circuit Activation Theory (WCAT) – v2.0

### A Metacognitive Framework for Reconstructing Volition and Meaning in the Age of AI

---

## 📖 Overview

**WCAT (Will Circuit Activation Theory)** is an interdisciplinary framework that explores how human volition, meaning-making, and cognitive freedom evolve across four neurocognitive systems.  

It draws upon neuroscience, metacognition, developmental psychology, memetics, and existential philosophy to explain how conscious agency can be restructured in an era dominated by genetic determinism, cultural conditioning, and algorithmic behavior shaping.

This repository contains the official **WCAT v2.0 whitepaper**, relevant appendices, references, and roadmap documents for the project's ongoing development and open collaboration.

## 🧬 Key Concepts

- **System I** — Developmental force rooted in genes and automatic neural impulses  
- **System II** — Meme-optimized volition; survival and social strategies  
- **System III** — Reflexive metacognition and meaning system reconstruction  
- **System IV** *(forthcoming)* — Emergent collective cognition and ethical co-evolution

🤝 Collaboration & Future Directions

We are in the early phase of developing:
 • 🧪 A WCAT-based online self-assessment system (wcat.world)
 • 📚 Experimental protocols for neuroscience verification
 • 💬 Open feedback and translation pipeline (GitHub + OSF)

If you are a researcher, developer, educator, or visionary interested in metacognitive freedom, feel free to reach out or fork the repository.
